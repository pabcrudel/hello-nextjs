# Hello Next.js

First approach to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) following the official
interactive course.

## Where am I learning Next.js

I found this interactive course in [Next.js' official page](https://nextjs.org/learnutm_source=next-siteutm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=home).
There you can find two courses:

1. [Create a dashboard app with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)
1. [React foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)

By now, I'm doing the first one because I've done some `React.js` courses
before:

- [React Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-tic-tac-toe)
- [React Data Fetching](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-data-fetching)
- [React eCommerce Shopping
  Cart](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-ecommerce-shopping-cart)
- [React Film Archive](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-film-archive)
- [React Router Clone](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-router-clone)

## Next.js Dashboard App

### Setting up the starting point

To start this course you must install it's starting point.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest dashboard-app --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```

>In that repository there are other 2 courses. However, they seem to be courses
>of previous `Next.js` version or they use different router API's:
>
>- [Create a Next.js
>  App](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app)
>- [Search Engine
>  Optimization](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/seo/introduction-to-seo)

Once created, the terminal shows that output:

```bash
Success! Created dashboard-app at D:\zcode\react\hello-nextjs\dashboard-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd dashboard-app
  npm run dev
```

First step is done.
