# Hello Next.js

First approach to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) following the official
interactive course.

## Where am I learning Next.js

I found this interactive course in [Next.js' official page](https://nextjs.org/learnutm_source=next-siteutm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=home).
There you can find two courses:

1. [Create a dashboard app with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)
1. [React foundations](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations)

By now, I'm doing the first one because I've done some `React.js` courses
before:

- [React Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-tic-tac-toe)
- [React Data Fetching](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-data-fetching)
- [React eCommerce Shopping
  Cart](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-ecommerce-shopping-cart)
- [React Film Archive](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-film-archive)
- [React Router Clone](https://github.com/pabcrudel/react-router-clone)
