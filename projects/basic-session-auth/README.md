# Basic Session Authentication

Example of how to use session to manage user authentication.

## Where I found this?

Searching on youtube I found a [video of Lee Robinson about this
topic (11:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJvM2lSPn6w). He explained how to
do that without additional libraries and using
[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/).
